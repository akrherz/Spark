This is a plugin for Spark that allows users to join audio and video conferences supported by [XEP-0483: HTTP Online Meetings](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0483.html)
See the documentation for more details. It provides a button from a Multi User Chat (MUC) room or chat window within the Spark client, to open a Chrome window using the URL provided. 
It uses Electron instead of depending on Chrome installed and configured as the default browser.

It is a much better user experience than opening a Chrome browser window out of context somewhere else. 
Screen sharing is not yet working. All Electron runtime platforms (windows, Linux & OSX) are supported. I have only tested it at home on my windows desktop. 
Feeback will be appreciated from Linux and OSX users.
